# Threat-Hunting-Practical-Documentation.
Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity practice that involves the systematic search for hidden threats within an organization’s IT environment. Unlike traditional security monitoring, which relies primarily on automated alerts and predefined rules, threat hunting focuses on detecting advanced, persistent, and stealthy threats (APTs) that may evade security tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or antivirus solutions. 


**Objectives of Threat Hunting**

•	Identify threats that bypass traditional defenses.

•	Detect indicators of compromise (IOCs) and indicators of attack (IOAs).

•	Reduce false positives from automated detection systems.

•	Enhance incident response capabilities.

•	Provide actionable threat intelligence for future defense strategies.

**Threat Hunting Process**

•	Gathering of Intel

•	Understand their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)

•	Using Mitre Navigator to map the TTPs to APTs

•	Overlap the TTPs of the APTs
